#### How it works

* This is a Super Mario Number Game using jQuery.
* Play the game by clicking one of the four mushrooms to add a number.
* If you get the number to match the random generated number then you win!
* If you the number is higher than the random generated number then you lose.
* Once the number either matches or goes over the generated number then the game auto resets with a new generated number.
* _Turn the audio on to hear extra effects!_
